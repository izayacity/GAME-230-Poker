# GAME-230-Poker

Video Poker is a single-player variant of 5-Card Draw Poker. The player starts with $10 and then pays a $1 ante and is first dealt a hand of 5 playing cards. They then choose which cards to "keep" and which to discard. The discarded cards are then replaced by drawing additional cards from the deck until the player again has 5 cards. Then, the game detects whether the player has a poker hand, and awards a certain number of dollars depending on how good their hand is. If the player still has money, they pay another $1 to play another round. If the player runs out of money, the game is over. The deck of cards will be persistent across rounds, allowing the player to better predict what cards will be drawn from the deck.
